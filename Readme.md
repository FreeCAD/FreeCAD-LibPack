This repository is to provide libraries needed to compile FreeCAD under Windows.

The LibPack is tested to work with Visual C++ (a.k.a. MSVC or VC). It should be possible to use other compilers MinGW, however this is nt tested.

For information how to use the LibPack to compiles, see this Wiki page: https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Compile_on_Windows
