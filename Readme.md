This repository is to provide libraries needed to compile FreeCAD under Windows.

The LibPack is tested to work with [Microsoft Visual C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_C%2B%2B) (a.k.a. MSVC or VC). It should be possible to use other compilers like MinGW, however this is not tested.

For information how to use the LibPack to compile, see this Wiki page: https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Compile_on_Windows
